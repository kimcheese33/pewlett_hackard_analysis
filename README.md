# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to utilize SQL and data modeling techniques in Postgres to obtain information on retiring employees. By creating an ERD, importing data into Postgres, and building tables and joins we were able to produce the desired results. We were able to produce two final deliverables: the first is a table containing the count of titles of current employees who are retiring, the second is a mentorship-eligibility table containing current employees born between Jan 1, 1965 and Dec 31, 1965.

## Results

- From the titles table, we discovered that 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff employees are retiring. In other words, 57,668 senior-level employees will be retiring.

- From the titles table, we also discovered that only 2 managers will be retiring.
